<p>Buffalo aims to make building new web applications in Go as simple as possible, and what could be more simple that a new application generator?</p>

<pre><code class="text">$ buffalo new &lt;name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>That will generate a whole new Buffalo application that is ready to go. It&rsquo;ll even run <code>go get</code> for you to make sure you have all of the necessary dependencies needed to run your application.</p>

<p>To see a list of available flags for the <code>new</code> command, just check out it&rsquo;s help.</p>

<pre><code class="text">$ buffalo help new</code></pre>

<h2 id="running-your-application">Running your application</h2>

<p>Buffalo is Go &ldquo;standards&rdquo; compliant, that means you can just build your binary and run it. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

<h3 id="running-your-application-in-development">Running your application in Development</h3>

<p>One of the downsides to Go development is the lack of code &ldquo;reloading&rdquo;. This means as you change your code you need to manually stop your application, rebuild it, and then restart it. Buffalo finds this is annoying, and wants to make life better for you.</p>

<pre><code class="text">$ buffalo dev</code></pre>

<p>The <code>dev</code> command will watch your <code>.go</code> and <code>.html</code> files by default and rebuild, and restart, your binary for you so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about such things. Just run the <code>dev</code> command and start coding.</p>

<h2 id="testing-your-application">Testing your application</h2>

<p>Just like running your application, Buffalo doesn&rsquo;t stop you from using the standard Go tools for testing. Buffalo does ship with a <code>test</code> command that will run all of your tests will convienently skipping that pesky old <code>./vendor</code> directory!</p>
