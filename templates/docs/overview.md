# Overview

Buffalo is a **Go web development** eco-system, designed to make the life of a Go web developer easier.

Buffalo starts by **generating** a web project for you that already has **everything** from front-end (JavaScript, SCSS, etc...) to back-end (database, routing, etc...) already hooked up and ready to run. From there it provides easy APIs to build your web application quickly in Go.

Buffalo isn't just a framework, it's a **holistic web development environment** and project structure that lets developers get straight to the business of, well, building their business.
